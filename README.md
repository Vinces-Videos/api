# vincesvideos
A chalet project

.NET Core 6.0
I installed this via homebrew. The command is `brew install dotnet`

Development Environment Configuration
I've used Visual Studio Code to prevent from the bloat of Visual Studio
A plugin named C# by Microsoft was added to Visual Studio Code to aid with intellisense and debugging
You will very likely need a localhost dev certificate which is trusted to debug the webapi
